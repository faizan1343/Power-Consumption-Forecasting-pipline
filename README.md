This repository contains a robust pipeline for forecasting power consumption over a 168-hour horizon using historical data from the American Electric Power (AEP) region. The project includes time-series modeling, data preprocessing, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize forecasts and model performance.

## Introduction and Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize historical data from the AEP region to develop a reliable pipeline for estimating power consumption over a 168-hour lead time. The primary goal is to develop, evaluate, and compare time-series models to forecast mean load and volatility, providing actionable insights for energy planning. The project features an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard showcasing 168-hour forecast plots, model comparisons, and a temperature map for the AEP region. Advanced statistical techniques are employed to handle large datasets and deliver meaningful results for real-world electricity demand challenges.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset, sourced from `AEP_hourly.csv`, consists of 121,273 hourly observations spanning January 10, 2004, to August 3, 2018. Key preprocessing steps include:

- **Initial Inspection**: Using pandas [1], a peak load of 25,695 MW was identified, with no missing values but potential outliers.
- **Cleaning**: Four duplicate records were removed, the `Datetime` column was converted to a datetime format, and 259 outliers (beyond three standard deviations) were retained for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plotly [2] visualizations confirmed daily and seasonal patterns, guiding modeling decisions.
- **Feature Engineering**: File 2 introduced features like `Hour`, `IsWeekend`, `Lag_1`, and `IsSummer`.
- **Interpolation**: File 3 interpolated 27 missing hours (likely due to Daylight Saving Time), resulting in 121,296 rows saved as `interpolated_dataset.pkl`.

## Time Series Modeling and Diagnostics

Multiple time-series models were developed to capture seasonal trends in power consumption:

- **ARIMA(1,1,1)**: A baseline model with an AIC of 1,747,740 and residual standard deviation of 327.54, lacking seasonal effects.
- **SARIMA(1,1,1)x(1,1,1,24)**: Captured 24-hour cycles using statsmodels [3], achieving an AIC of 1,602,426 and residual standard deviation of 183.81.
- **Exponential Smoothing**: With additive seasonality and trend (period=24), it yielded the lowest AIC of 1,385,098, despite a convergence warning.
- **GARCH(1,1)**: Applied to rescaled data (AEP_MW / 1000), it modeled volatility with an AIC of -70.37 and volatility interval of 1,000–1,500 MW.

Stationarity was confirmed via ADF (p-value: 2.34e-30) and KPSS (p=0.01) tests, justifying differencing. Volatility clustering was observed in SARIMA residuals (ACF lag 24 = 0.181), prompting GARCH modeling.

## Forecasting and Evaluation

All models generated 168-hour forecasts for August 3–10, 2018:
- **Mean Load**: Forecasted by ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing.
- **Volatility**: Estimated by GARCH.
- **Performance**:
  - **Exponential Smoothing**: Best mean model (AIC: 1,385,098).
  - **SARIMA**: Strong residual standard deviation (183.81).
  - **ARIMA**: Lagged due to lack of seasonality (AIC: 1,747,740, residual std dev: 327.54).
  - **GARCH**: Suitable for volatility (residual std dev: 0.259).
- **Visualization**: Plot 1 in the dashboard shows daily cycles with GARCH volatility at 6–12% of mean load (12,000–17,000 MW).

Due to the absence of post-August 3, 2018, data, validation relied on in-sample fit. An exploratory 12-month prediction was abandoned due to limitations.

## Discussion

The pipeline successfully forecasted 168-hour power consumption, with Exponential Smoothing leading due to its lowest AIC, despite convergence issues that could be mitigated with parameter tuning. SARIMA excelled in seasonal modeling (residual std dev: 183.81), while ARIMA underscored the importance of seasonal components. GARCH effectively modeled volatility (1,000–1,500 MW), though a low beta[1] (0.0178) suggests potential for improvement (e.g., GARCH(1,2)). Interpolation handled 27 missing hours adequately, but incorporating variables like temperature could enhance accuracy. The dashboard’s interactivity, including a horizon slider, adds practical utility, with potential for future cloud hosting.

## Conclusion

This project delivers a robust power consumption forecasting pipeline with an interactive Streamlit dashboard and reliable 168-hour forecasts. SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing provide strong mean forecasts, while GARCH tracks volatility patterns. Future enhancements include integrating real-time data, online deployment, and auto-tuning models (e.g., `pmdarima.auto_arima`).
