Final Summary:
- Best Mean Model: Exponential Smoothing (AIC: 1385098, stabilized) is the top performer for mean prediction, 
  with SARIMA (AIC: 1602426, residual std dev: 183.81) as a stable alternative. ARIMA (AIC: 1747740, 
  residual std dev: 327.54) underperforms due to lack of seasonality.
- Volatility Model: GARCH(1,1) with rescaling (/1000) provides volatility forecasts (1000-1500 MW), 
  capturing daily volatility patterns, though persistence (beta[1] = 0.0178) could be improved.
- Forecasts: The 168-hour forecasts (2018-08-03 to 2018-08-10) exhibit daily cycles, with SARIMA and 
  ES outperforming ARIMA in capturing load variations, as seen in the visualization.
- Limitation: No actual data beyond 2018-08-03 limits validation; results are based on in-sample fit.
